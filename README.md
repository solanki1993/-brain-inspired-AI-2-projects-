Brain inspired AI-Boltzmann machine trained on the MNIST data and temporal difference learning model for navigating Morris water-maze task
Project 1: Build and train a Boltzmann machine on the MNIST dataset. Boltzmann machines are a specific type of PDP model designed for unsupervised learning.
Project 2: Reproducing a combined coordinate and TD algorithm for solving the Morris water-maze task.
